## **Overview**

This repository presents the fine-tuning of the **FLAN-T5** model for generating **positive and less toxic text** while ensuring computational efficiency through **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)**. By applying advanced reinforcement learning techniques like **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** and **Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)**, this project balances enhanced text quality and reduced resource usage, achieving significant performance improvements.

## **Problem Statement**

Language models often produce toxic or negative content unintentionally, which can hinder their application in sensitive domains. Additionally, inference efficiency remains a critical challenge due to the computational demands of large-scale models. This project addresses these challenges by:  
1. Improving the positivity of text outputs.  
2. Reducing the computational overhead during inference without compromising accuracy.

2. **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT):**  
   - Reduced the number of trainable parameters during fine-tuning.  
   - Achieved faster inference while preserving model accuracy.  

3. **Evaluation:**  
   - Used **ROUGE** and **BLEU** scores to evaluate content quality.  
   - Conducted toxicity tests to ensure improvements in output positivity.
